## Overview
In this repo I attempted to ...

## Objectives
- To analyze and visualize Saudi cities walkability conditions
- To provide a comprehensive dataset containing all necessary data
- To create a walk score measure that is suitable for the Saudi context

## Research Questions
- Are Saudi cities walkable? Can most daily errands be completed on foot?
- Which Saudi city in the analysis is the most walkable?
- What are the factors that are most contributing to the Saudi walk score?

## Notebooks Descriptions
1. **Data_Collection**
2. **Data_Preperation**
3. **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis)
4. **ML_Modeling** (Machine Learning Modeling)
5. **Saudi Walk Score**

## Dataset Description
The analysis was done on an aggregated dataset from different resources including:
- Coordinates (latitude, longitude) of different Saudi cities
- WalkScore API's
- Pedestrian First API's
- Weather API's

The dataset contains the following variables:
| **Variable** | **Description** |
| :---: | :---: |
| Name | Point name |
| City | Name of the city |
| Latitude  | Measurement of distance north or south of the Equator |
| Longitude | Measurement of distance east or west of the Equator |
| WalkScore | WalkScore API from |
| Pedestrian First | Pedestrian First API from |
| Weather | Weater API from |
You can access the dataset directly from the data folder in this repository.

## Notes
This project is a work in progress as I add more relevant data to the dataset and become a better spatial data scientist
